# Student Management System

An AI-agent-powered student management system built with .NET 10 and React. It manages student records, internship payments, and exam grades — with a multi-process AI agent that can parse uploaded documents (OCR), answer natural language queries about the data, and generate formatted Word/Excel reports.

## Architecture

The solution follows a **Service-Oriented Clean Architecture** with pure DI (no MediatR). Dependencies flow inward only: Domain ← Application ← Infrastructure ← API. The AI agent runs as a separate process and communicates with the API over HTTP; MCP tools are exposed via a third process.

### Key design decisions

- **No MediatR** — plain service interfaces keep the call graph explicit and easy to trace.
- **Agent is a singleton** — `StudentManagementAgent` and its MCP client are registered as singletons; the tool cache is lazily initialised once and shared across requests.
- **Stateless agent requests** — conversation history is never held in memory. Each request carries the session ID; the infrastructure layer resolves history from a Redis sliding-window cache (last 20 messages, 24 h TTL) with MongoDB as the permanent append-only backing store.
- **DDD entity encapsulation** — `Student` has private setters and exposes mutations through domain methods (`Update`, `Anonymize`), preventing accidental direct assignment.
- **Fail-closed CORS** — production startup throws if `AllowedOrigin` is not configured, making misconfiguration loud rather than silent.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- Docker Desktop (for local infrastructure and integration tests)
- Azure OpenAI resource (GPT-4o deployment)
- Azure AI Document Intelligence resource

## Getting Started

### 1. Start infrastructure

```bash
docker run -d --name postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=studentmanagement \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=studentmanagement \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=studentmanagement \
  -p 5432:5432 postgres:16-alpine

docker run -d --name mongodb \
  -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin \
  -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password \
  -p 27017:27017 mongo:6.0

docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine
```

### 2. Configure the API

Edit `src/StudentManagement.Api/appsettings.Development.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "Postgres":  "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=studentmanagement;Username=studentmanagement;Password=studentmanagement",
    "Mongo":     "mongodb://admin:password@localhost:27017/student_management?authSource=admin",
    "MongoLog":  "mongodb://admin:password@localhost:27017?authSource=admin",
    "Redis":     "localhost:6379"
  },
  "AzureDocumentIntelligence": {
    "Endpoint": "https://<your-resource>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/",
    "ApiKey":   "<your-api-key>"
  },
  "AllowedOrigin": "http://localhost:5173"
}
```

Edit `src/StudentManagement.Agent/appsettings.Development.json` with your Azure OpenAI endpoint, API key, and deployment name.

### 3. Run all three processes

```bash
# Terminal 1 — API
cd src/StudentManagement.Api && dotnet run

# Terminal 2 — MCP tool server
cd src/StudentManagement.MCP && dotnet run

# Terminal 3 — AI Agent
cd src/StudentManagement.Agent && dotnet run
```

| Process | URL |
|---|---|
| API + Scalar docs | `http://localhost:5000` → `http://localhost:5000/scalar/v1` |
| Agent + Scalar docs | `http://localhost:5200` → `http://localhost:5200/scalar/v1` |
| MCP tool server | `http://localhost:5100` |

### 4. Run the frontend

```bash
cd student-management-ui
npm install && npm run dev
```

Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Key Features

### AI Document Processing

Upload a payment or exam grade document (PDF/image). Azure Document Intelligence extracts the structured data; the agent maps it to existing student records using fuzzy name matching (Levenshtein distance). Confidence below 85% triggers a **Human-in-the-Loop** step — the user must confirm ambiguous matches before any database write occurs.

### Persistent Chat Sessions

Every agent conversation is stored in two layers:

- **Redis** — sliding window of the last 20 messages with a 24-hour TTL for fast context retrieval.
- **MongoDB** — append-only full history for audit and replay. On cache miss the agent warms Redis from MongoDB automatically.

### Natural Language Queries

Ask the agent questions like "How much was Ahmet paid this month?" or "List all Computer Science students enrolled this year." The agent selects the appropriate MCP tool, fetches the data from the API, and returns a human-readable answer.

### Document Generation

Request a Word exam paper or Excel payment summary in natural language. The agent assembles the content; the infrastructure layer renders a formatted `.docx` or `.xlsx` and returns it as a file download.

### Real-time Progress Updates

A SignalR hub pushes progress events to the frontend during long-running OCR and agent operations, so users see incremental feedback rather than waiting for a full response.

### Audit Logging

An EF Core interceptor records every write operation (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) to MongoDB's `AuditLogs` collection, capturing the entity state before and after the change, user context, and session correlation ID.

### GDPR Anonymization

The `Student` entity exposes an `Anonymize()` domain method that blanks personal fields in a single atomic operation, honoring the right to erasure without deleting the record's referential integrity.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests — no external dependencies
dotnet test tests/StudentManagement.UnitTests

# Integration tests — requires Docker
dotnet test tests/StudentManagement.IntegrationTests
```

> [!NOTE]
> Integration tests use **Testcontainers** and automatically spin up isolated PostgreSQL, Redis, and MongoDB containers. Docker must be running. The test factory injects all required configuration (connection strings, placeholder Azure keys) so no real Azure credentials are needed.

### Test coverage at a glance

| Suite | Count | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | 26 | Agent orchestration, application services, domain invariants, infrastructure interceptors |
| Integration | 7 | Student CRUD endpoints, payment upsert/query — real DB + cache round-trips |

## CI/CD

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) runs on every push and pull request to `main` and `develop`:

1. **Unit tests** run first with Cobertura code coverage collected and uploaded as an artifact.
2. **Integration tests** run in a subsequent job (only if unit tests pass), using the Docker socket available on `ubuntu-latest` to start Testcontainers.

## Project Background

This system was built phase-by-phase following a specification-driven workflow. The phase prompts in `.github/prompts/` document each architectural decision from domain modeling through AI agent integration and automated testing.
